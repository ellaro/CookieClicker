# CookieClicker
A Selenium automation project that automatically clicks the cookie in the Cookie Clicker game.
Cookie Clicker Bot.

How to run:

The required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you have chromedriver.exe placed in your project directory.

Run the script:

python main.py


Watch as the browser automatically opens, interacts with the site, and prints progress messages to the console.

A Python automation script that plays Cookie Clicker automatically using Selenium WebDriver.
Description

This script:

    Opens the Chrome browser.

    Navigates to Cookie Clicker.

    Selects English as the language.

    Continuously clicks the big cookie to collect cookies.

    Prints the current cookie count to the console.

Requirements

    Python 3.7+

    selenium package

    webdriver_manager package

    Google Chrome browser installed

Installation

Install the required libraries:

pip install selenium webdriver-manager


What the Script Does

    Automatically opens the Cookie Clicker website.

    Waits for the language selection to appear and chooses English.

    Finds the big cookie element (bigCookie).

    Starts clicking the cookie extremely fast in an infinite loop.

    Continuously prints the number of cookies collected.

Notes

    The loop is infinite (while True), so you'll need to manually stop the script (CTRL+C or stop it from the terminal).

    The time.sleep(0.0000001) slightly delays the clicks but keeps them extremely fast.

    Make sure your ChromeDriver version matches your installed Chrome browser version â€” this is handled automatically using webdriver_manager.
